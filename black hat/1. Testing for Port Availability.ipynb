    "First, you create a channel by using make() v. A second parameter, an int value of 100 , is provided to make() here. This allows the channel to be buffered, which means you can send it an item without waiting for a receiver to read the item. Buffered channels are ideal for maintaining and track- ing work for multiple producers and consumers. You’ve capped the chan- nel at 100, meaning it can hold 100 items before the sender will block. This is a slight performance increase, as it will allow all the workers to\n",

Notice that you aren’t doing any work yet in the worker—that’ll come shortly. Iterating over the ports sequentially in the main() function, you send a port on the ports channel x to the worker.
